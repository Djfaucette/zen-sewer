# Zen Sewer

Zen Garden, but for sludge.  Instead of writing CSS to beautify the included HTML, try to make the page as slow as possible with just CSS.  Slowness can include load speed, animation speed, anything that makes the devtools Performance tab cringe.

## Quick-start

```
git clone git@github.com:mwcz/zen-sewer.git
npx serve
```
